## Experience with Project
- This is my second course in the Specialization and it was based around Angular. 
- This was my first time using Angular and Angular Material
## Project setup
Once the project is downloaded locally on your device do the following:
`
npm install
`

If there are dependencies that need updating or you want to check:
`
npm outdated
`

If there are outdated dependencies:
`
npm updated
`

To check and update packages in package.json:
`
npx npm-check-updates -u
`

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
`
npm run start
`

### Compiles and minifies for production
`
npm run build
`

### Lints and fixes files
`
npm run lint
`
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
